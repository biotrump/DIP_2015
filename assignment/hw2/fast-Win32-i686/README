Usage:

FastDemo [/l] [/t X] [/n X] [/b] [/?] input_image output_file

Options:

input_image        Input filename
output_file        Output filename 
/l                 Output a list of corners (instead of an image)
/t X               Set threshold to X. Default is 20
/n X               Use X point fast (allowed range is 9--12, default is 9)
/s                 Perform nonmaximal suppression
/b                 Display bibtex entries
/?                 Display help message

example:
