1. transfer function, linear, log, exponetnial
2. histogrm equlization, CDF , bucket filling, the difference 
3. noise removel, mean, median, gaussian noise, uniform noise, how to remove
4.  how to detect edge : first order, sobel, 2nd order derivative, zero-crossing,
homogenous is also zero-crossing,
canny edge detection :
1. noise removel
2. non-maximalsuppression
